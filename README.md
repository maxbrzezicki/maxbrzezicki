- 👋 Hi, I’m @maxbrzezicki
- 👀 I love playing rugby, rowing, cooking, and trekking in the wilderness. I spend my free time building electronic brains, studying fallen civilizations and wearing Icelandic sweaters. Fun fact? I can order pizza in 10 languages, including 3 dead ones.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning machine learning, python/JS webapp frameworks, arduino integrations
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on body sensors, brain computer integration
- 📫 How to reach me: @maxbrzezicki on ig or twitter, mbrzezicki@neurologicalsociety.org, https://maxbrzezicki.com
